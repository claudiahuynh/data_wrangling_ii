```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)
library(httr)
```

```{r}
url = "http://samhda.s3-us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/field-uploads/2k15StateFiles/NSDUHsaeShortTermCHG2015.htm"
drug_use_html = read_html(url)

```

Get the pieces I actually need 

```{r}
marj_use_df =
  drug_use_html |> 
  html_table() |> 
  first() |> 
  slice(-1)
```

Practice 
Title was imported as first row in the data. 
```{r}
url = "https://www.bestplaces.net/cost_of_living/city/new_york/new_york"
cost_living = read_html(url)

cost_living |> 
  html_table(header = TRUE)
```
